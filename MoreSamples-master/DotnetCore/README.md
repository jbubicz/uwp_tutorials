## Dependency Injection

Folder: DependencyInjection

This sample offers a simple console project using dependency injection with the Microsoft.Extensions.DependencyInjection framework.

See the blog article [Dependency Injection with .NET Core](https://csharp.christiannagel.com/2016/06/04/dependencyinjection/ "Dependency Inection") for more information.

The Simple MVVM sample makes use of Microsoft.Extensions.DependencyInjection as well.

The book Professional C# 6 and .NET Core 1.0 offers a bigger example with MVVM and both WPF and UWP applications in the chapter 31, "Patterns with XAML Apps", and in the ASP.NET Core chapters 40 "ASP.NET Core" and 41 "ASP.NET MVC". 

## Dependency Injection with Options

Folder: DependencyInjectionWithOptions

This sample extends on the Dependency Injection sample to add options for configuration of the injected service.

See the blog article [.NET Core Dependency Injection with Options](https://csharp.christiannagel.com/2016/07/27/diwithoptions/ "DI with Options") for more information.

## Configuration

Folder: ConfigurationSample

This sample shows .NET Core configuration with a simple console application. The book contains configuration information in Chapter 40, ASP.NET Core.

## Self-Contained application

Folder: SelfContained

This sample shows how to create self-contained .NET Core applications in contrary to portable applications.
