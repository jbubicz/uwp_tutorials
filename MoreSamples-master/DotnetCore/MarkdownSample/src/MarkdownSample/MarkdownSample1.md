What is the best markdown library?

I've never spent so much time writing on a new book as with **Professional C# 6 and .NET Core 1.0**

What about an image?


![An image](https://csharpdotchristiannageldotcom.files.wordpress.com/2016/06/professionalcsharp6.png "Professional C# 6")

And source code as well:

```csharp
public string Greeting(string name)
{
	return $"Hello, {name}";
}
```

Code can also be written within text: `WriteLine("Hello, World")` - this is cool

Here's a list:

* One
* Two
* Three
* Four

The list can also be numbered:

1. One
2. Two
3. Three

With sub-lists:
1. One
	* a
	* b
	* C
2. Two
	* d
	* e
	* f


And a table:

| title 1  | title 2  | title 3 |
| -------  | -------- | ------- |
| cell 1   | cell 2   | cell 3  |
| cell 4   | cell 5   | cell 6  |
